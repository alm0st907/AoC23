Advent of code 2023

I'm doing this mostly to learn go and poke around at it. 

Some notes:
- Some of this code will be blatantly gleaned from others.
I'm not trying to pass this off as my own work, just trying to learn and get more comfortable without doing leetcode.
- I probably won't be able to keep up with the calendar, I have a life and things to do.
